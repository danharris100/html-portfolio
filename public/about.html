<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm 50 years old and at the very (very) beginning of my software development
  journey.
</p>

<p>
  Amazingly I hope one day to make money from this so unless people are after
  retro websites that could be done by 5 year olds I'm hoping that I can develop
  my skills further. But you've got to start somewhere, right?
