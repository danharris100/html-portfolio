<h1>The Best Films According To Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 5 films of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Life of Brian</h3>
<p>
  Should I like it? Is it appropriate? I'm not sure but what I do know is that
  it's flipping funny. Some of the best film quotes of all time. Try not to feel
  guilty and just enjoy it.
</p>
<h3>Anchorman</h3>
<p>
  A comedy classic, laugh out loud funny. Some of the best comedy characters
  ever created with a ton more quotes to remember and use.
</p>
<h3>Paddington 2</h3>
<p>
  I probably shouldn't like this as much as I do but I can't help it. Without
  doubt Hugh Grant's best acting (although a fairly low bar). It makes prison
  look quite appealing.
